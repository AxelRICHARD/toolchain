= How to Contribute =

Writing documentation is everybody's task.  Don't ask for permission to contribute, just do it.

As of this writing (4-Mar-2014), the documentation is stored in a single Wiki page.  To prevent editing conflicts, please follow these rules:

* Note that this page uses MediaWiki Markup (not gitHub wiki Markup)
* If you are missing documentation, please create a stub for it: Find the place where you think it would be appropriate, and insert a section name, preceded by TODO.  That way we know that something is missing.
* If you want to contribute content to a section, then:
** First edit the section name, by removing the TODO and replace it with your name, e.g. "Michael: How to Contribute".  Then safe the page.  That way, someone looking at the page (hopefully) knows not to edit in the same section.
** Work on the section as you see fit.
** When you're done, remove your name.  However, if the content is not complete, put the word TODO back into the section name.
** If you get a conflict upon safe, hopefully the conflict is in a different section.  In that case, copy your contribution (which is hopefully limited to one section), reload the page, and insert your content.
