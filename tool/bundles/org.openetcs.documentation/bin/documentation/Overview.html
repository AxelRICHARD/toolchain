		<h1 id="How_to_Contribute">How to Contribute</h1>
		<p>Writing documentation is everybody's task.  Don't ask for permission to contribute, just do it.</p>
		<p>As of this writing (4-Mar-2014), the documentation is stored in a single Wiki page.  To prevent editing conflicts, please follow these rules:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Note that this page uses MediaWiki Markup (not gitHub wiki Markup)</li>
			<li>If you are missing documentation, please create a stub for it: Find the place where you think it would be appropriate, and insert a section name, preceded by TODO.  That way we know that something is missing.</li>
			<li>If you want to contribute content to a section, then:
				<ul>
					<li>First edit the section name, by removing the TODO and replace it with your name, e.g. "Michael: How to Contribute".  Then safe the page.  That way, someone looking at the page (hopefully) knows not to edit in the same section.</li>
					<li>Work on the section as you see fit.</li>
					<li>When you're done, remove your name.  However, if the content is not complete, put the word TODO back into the section name.</li>
					<li>If you get a conflict upon safe, hopefully the conflict is in a different section.  In that case, copy your contribution (which is hopefully limited to one section), reload the page, and insert your content.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<ul>
			<li>Please make sure that artwork is correspondingly licensed.  Here is a CC-licensed icon set that is used for tips, hints, warnings, etc.:

			</li>
			<li>You need to upload artwork via git to /tool/documentation-artwork.  Please use folders to organize the pictures.</li>
			<li>To use an image, find the raw URL and put it in double square brackets.</li>
