= System Requirements =

It is recommended to use Java 6 (aka Java 1.6) to execute openETCS tool chain.

Some functionalities (e.g. ProR "Rich Text" extension) won't work with Java 6 and require Java 7. However, core tools of openETCS tool chain (e.g. Papyrus SysML editor) have not been qualified for Java 7.

= Installation procedure =
*	The openETCS Toolchain is available in the following URL for downloading: https://openetcs.ci.cloudbees.com/job/openETCS-tycho/28/artifact/tool/bundles/org.openetcs.releng.products/target/
*	Unzip main folder to extract the content in the desired location.
*	Launch openETCS executable file to run Eclipse.
*	Select your workspace.

== Installing ProR Essentials ==

There are a number of free (but currently not open) extensions that are useful for working with openETCS. As they are not open, they have to be installed manually.  Currently this includes:

* '''Suspect Links''' - indicates if source or target of a link have changed.
* '''Rich Text''' - shows formatted text properly formatted, and allows editing with a rich text editor.

[[https://raw.github.com/openETCS/toolchain/master/tool/documentation-artwork/icons/alert.png]]  The '''Rich Text''' extension requires Java 7 from Oracle, as it relies on the JavaFX component.

Here are the steps:

* Select <tt>Help | Install new Software...</tt>
* You need to enter a new update site in the <tt>Works with</tt> box (if you entered it before, you can select it from the drop down): <tt>http://update.formalmind.com/essentials</tt>
* From the Category <tt>ProR Essentials for Eclipse RMF</tt> select:
** <tt>ProR Linkmanagement Presentation Feature</tt>
** <tt>ProR Xhtml Rtf Presentation Feature</tt>

[[https://raw.github.com/openETCS/toolchain/master/tool/documentation-artwork/icons/alert.png]]  Make sure you select version 0.10 or better.  The update site structure will probably change in the future.
