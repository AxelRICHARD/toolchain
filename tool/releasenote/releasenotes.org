 #246 Included JRE in Tycho-Build

There is a feature for every platform including the JRE. The JRE is set in the openETCS.ini via touchpoint instructions. This appraoch allows to update users JRE by updating the feature. Since the JRE is not placed as a root file this mechanism also works in windows machines.
