\paragraph{Abstract} Short abstract on the approach and tool (10 lines max)

The formal language Event-B is based on a set-theoretic approach. It is a variant of the B
language, with a focus on system level modeling and has also be defined by  Jean-Raymond Abrial. An Event-B model is separated into a static
and a dynamic part.

Rodin is an industrial strength formal modeling tool. It allows the application of the Event-B approach to formal systems modeling. It provides proof obligation creation for invariants, refinement relations and data types. It comprises an Eclipse based modeling framework and supports numerous plugins, e.g., graphical modeling (iUML), automated proof support (theorem provers, SMT solvers) and traceability of requirements (ProR). It was developed by various academic and industrial partners in the European Union Projects RODIN (2003-2007), DEPLOY (2008-2012) and currently ADVANCE (2011-2014).

\section{Main usage of the approach}
\label{main_usage}
This section discusses the main usage of the approach.

According to the figure \ref{fig:main_process}, for which phases do you recommend the approach (give a note from 0 to  3) :

\begin{tabular}{|l | c | c | c | c|}

\hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{author_comment}
This approach is designed for analyses at the early stage of the development of a system. Its capabilities of abstraction allow easy system level reasoning, without taking into account implementation details. Classical B, based on the same language is better adapted for software design and code generation \ref{chap:classicalB}.

It is possible to generate C or Ada code from an Event-B model \url{http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/336226/1/ABZ2012_short_v20120202.pdf} and \url{http://deploy-eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/375/1/AdaEurope2012.pdf}. Two  approaches are on development: \url{http ://wiki.event-b.org/index.php/Code_Generation_Activity} and \url{http://eb2all.loria.fr/}. However, the Event-B specification must be sufficiently detailed to generate code, and this code generator do not take care of software constraints on critical systems or code optimisation.
\end{author_comment}


According to the figure \ref{fig:main_process}, for which type of activities do you recommend the approach (give a note from 0 to  3) :

\begin{author_comment}
This approach is not sufficient to cover all the safety analyses activities. But it is useful to give confidence on the analyses on a mathematical model. See \url{http://www.erts2012.org/Site/0P2RUC89/4D-2.pdf}.
\end{author_comment}


\paragraph{Known usages} Have you some examples of usage of this approach to  compare with the OpenETCS objectives ?


\begin{author_comment}
This approach has already been used in railway on two  main critical systems: modelling the DIR41 (instead the generic specification of all interlocking systems used in the metro in Paris)  and modelling the track-side controller from the metro of Lyon. 

There are others application in the automotive and aeronautic domains. See for more details: \url{http://wiki.event-b.org/index.php/Industrial_Projects}

\section{Language}

\hline
Graphical language & 2     & 2     & 2     & \textcolor{blue}{6} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{author_comment}
Event-B  is a formal language with a mathematical notation. But the Rodin tool can be completed with plug-in like iUML \url{http://wiki.event-b.org/index.php/IUML-B} allows to model directly state-machine or block diagram  graphically and to  give the event-B mathematical translation.
\end{author_comment}

\begin{assessor2}
  The Rodin editor suggest a textual representation of Machines and
  Contexts, however under the hood it uses XML files. The Event-B
  Context and Event-B Machine Editor has a form based interface for
  editing, making the non plain text models more apparent.
\end{assessor2}

\section{Sub-System formal design}
This section discusses the usage of the approach for sub-system formal design.
It can be skipped depending the results of \ref{main_usage}.

Two kinds of model can be planned during this phase: semi-formal models to  cover the SSRS (D2.6-02-047.01) and strictly formal  models to  focuss on some functional and safety aspects (D2.6-02-049).  Obviously some strictly  formal means can be used to define the semi-formal  model.

\subsection{Semi-formal model}

\paragraph{Additional comments on semi-formal  model} Do you think your semi-formal  model is sufficient to cover a safe design of the on-board unit until code generation ?
All comments on links to  other models, validation and verification activities are welcomed.


\begin{author_comment}
Event-B  approach is well adapted for system analysis and design. However other formal approach as Classical-B \ref{chap:classicalB} or Scade are more relevant to be used during software design to code generation of critical systems.

\paragraph{Model verification}
Which verification on models are provided by the tool?

\begin{author_comment}

Syntax, type verification,
refinement verification
formal proof of properties (validation)
\end{author_comment}

\paragraph{Test generation}
Does the tool allow to generate tests ? For  which purpose ?

\begin{author_comment}

The tool is not design to generate test, however we can imagine means to  generate test from event-B machine (Rodin can be linked to the model checker ProB).
\end{author_comment}

\begin{assessor2}
  There exist literature regarding test generation based on Event-B
  models, for example
  \url{http://deploy-eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/349/13/multiobj_testop.pdf}. Furthermore,
  a MBT plugin exists for Rodin,
  \url{http://wiki.event-b.org/index.php/MBT_plugin}.
\end{assessor2}

\paragraph{Simulation, execution, debugging}
Does the tool allow to simulate or to debbug step by step a model or a code ?

\begin{author_comment}

Two plug-ins (ProB \url{http://wiki.event-b.org/index.php/ProB} and animateB \url{http://wiki.event-b.org/index.php/AnimB}) are currently existing to simulate and animate the Event-B models. It is also possible to animate state machines\url{http://wiki.event-b.org/index.php/UML-B_-_Statemachine_Animation}.
\end{author_comment}

\paragraph{Formal proof}
Does the tool allow formal proof ?  How ?

\begin{author_comment}

Formal proof is one of the most important artefacts of the tool. different elements take part of the formal proof:
\begin{itemize}
\item proof generator
\item interactive prover
\item automatic prover
\item plug-in to link to SAT solver
\item plug-in to model-checker as ProB
\item plug-in to AtelierB prover
\end{itemize}

\begin{author_comment}
The tool is based on Eclipse on EUPL licence. Thus is can be associated to  other tools on eclipse easily, for example: EMF model comparator, Git plug-in,...
\end{author_comment}

\begin{assessor2}
  The Rodin tool is composed of a collection of plugins. Depending on
  the plugin, the license vary from proprietary to open source,
  e.g. EPL.
\end{assessor2}

\begin{assessor2}
  Distributed development is supported via plugins for SCM on a file
  basis. I don't know if CDO \url{http://wiki.eclipse.org/CDO} is
  supported by Rodin, which would enhance version controlling,
  distributed and concurrent development.
\end{assessor2}
