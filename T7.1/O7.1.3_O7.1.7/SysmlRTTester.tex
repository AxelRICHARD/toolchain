\paragraph{Abstract} Short abstract on the approach and tool 
SysML \cite{SysML} is a graphical language that extends UML for a customize
version suitable for system engineering. It may help modeling system within a board range of
system variety that may include hardware, software, data, personnel and facilities. It supports the
specification, analysis design, verification and validation of complex system.

Enterprise architect (EA) version 9.3 \cite{website} has been used to implement
the model. EA provides SysML and UML modelling capabilities.
EA is a visual platform for designing and constructing
software systems, for business process modeling, and for more generalized modeling purposes. it
covers all aspects of the development cycle. The main advantages is the requirement management
and tracing, the team work and the include versionning. The main cons : it is not an open source
tool.

\section{Main usage of the approach}
\label{main_usage}
This section discusses the main usage of the approach.

According to the figure \ref{fig:main_process}, for which phases do you recommend the approach (give a note from 0 to  3) :

\begin{tabular}{|l | c | c | c | c|}
\hline
& \textcolor{green}{Author} & \textcolor{blue}{Assessor 1} & \textcolor{magenta}{Assessor 2} & Total \\
\hline 
System Analysis & 3  & 3 & 3 & 9 \\

Sub-system formal design & 3 & 3 & 2 & 7 \\
\hline
Software design & 3 & 2 & 3 & 7 \\
\hline
Software code generation & 1 & 1 & 1 & 3 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\begin{author_comment}
Enterprise architect is able to generate C, java ... code from the UML/SysML
representation. This capability has not been tested by me. Moreover
from the serialized form of the model (xmi) it is possible to use
other tool to perform different task including code gneration.
\end{author_comment}
\begin{assessor2}
Sub-system formal design: SysML is a semiformal language. The syntax is formally defined in the standard, but semantics is expressed in natural language and often purposely left ambigiuos to allow for maximum flexibility of the language.
Software design: SysML can be linked in EA to UML model elements since SysML itself is a profile of UML. Therefore the approach is well suited for SW design.
\end{assessor2}

According to the figure \ref{fig:main_process}, for which type of activities do you recommend the approach (give a note from 0 to  3) :

\begin{tabular}{|l | c | c | c | c|}
\hline
& \textcolor{green}{Author} & \textcolor{blue}{Assessor 1} & \textcolor{magenta}{Assessor 2} & Total \\
\hline 
Documentation & 2 & 3 & 3 & 7 \\
\hline

\hline
Validation & 1 & 1 & 2 & 4 \\
\hline
Safety analyses & 2 & 2 & 2 & 6 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\begin{author_comment}
As said before, the model from enterprise architect may be imported
with a bit of effort (adapt parser to EA xmi) into other tools or some
tool may be plugged to EA. The model may be then used for the
different tasks of the table.
\end{author_comment}
\begin{assessor2}
Documentation: SysML diagrammes can be regarded as a good way of documenting system design. EA can be used to automatically generate documents from the model.
Code generation: EA can generate code and allows for cunstamization with templates, but the set of output languages is restricted. To support other output languages substantial modification of EA via plugins is required which is not well documented.
Validation: SysML was designed to facilitate the communication between stakeholders with different expertise. The graphical notationis relatively easy to understand and this supports an early validation that customer needs will be satisfied.
\end{assessor2}


\paragraph{Known usages} Have you some examples of usage of this
approach to  compare with the OpenETCS objectives ?

Plenty of experiences using SysML or UML in embedded system may be
found, the reader may refer to the proceeding of international
conference such as : Conference on Systems Engineering
Research (CSER), International Conference on Model-Based Systems Engineering
(MBSE), Embedded realtime software and systems (ERTS).
 

\section{Language}
This section discusses the main element of the language.

Which are the main characteristics of the language :

\begin{tabular}{|l | c | c | c | c|}
\hline
& \textcolor{green}{Author} & \textcolor{blue}{Assessor 1} & \textcolor{magenta}{Assessor 2} & Total \\
\hline

\hline
Mathematical symbols or code & 1 & 1 & 3 & 5 \\
\hline

\hline
\end{tabular}
\begin{assessor2}
Mathematical symbols or code: Mathematical code can be inserted in blocks and equation systems can be expressed using parametrics diagrammes.
\end{assessor2}



According WP2 requirements, give a note for the capabilities of the language (from 0 to 3) :

\begin{tabular}{|l | c | c | c | c|}
\hline
& \textcolor{green}{Author} & \textcolor{blue}{Assessor 1} & \textcolor{magenta}{Assessor 2} & Total \\
\hline

\hline
Extensible language (D.2.6-01-28) &3 & 3& 3& 9 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\begin{assessor2}
Expertise level needed: On the one hand, SysML diagrammes support a large ammount of notation so diagrammes can become quite complex. On the other hand, the graphical notation supports an intuitive understandig of the model.
\end{assessor2}

\paragraph{Documentation} 
SysML is  defined and standardized by OMG. They provide a complete
definition of the language and a guideline on the methodology
\cite{SysML}. The serialized form (the textual representation of the
graphical model) is also defined and standardized by OMG (see the XMI
definition).

Enterprise architect gives tutorial and sample model to start
with. The tool is really easy to use.

\paragraph{Language usage} 
SysML is dedicated on system engineering and suitable for a board range of
system variety. Using stereotype and profile the language may be
extended and customized according to the user need following the
specific domain of the modeled system.


\section{System Analysis}
This section discusses the usage of the approach for system analysis.
It can be skipped depending the results of \ref{main_usage}.

Acoording WP2 requirements, how the approach can be involved for the sub-system requirement specification ?

\hline
\end{tabular}
\begin{author_comment}
  SysML proposes a choice of diagrams to describes the system or the
  software under consideration. It is then possible to represent the
  system at different level of abstraction. Moreover one of the main
  addition of SysML compare to UML is the requirement diagram that
  makes the link between the model and the requirements.
\end{author_comment}


\section{Sub-System formal design}
This section discusses the usage of the approach for sub-system formal design.
It can be skipped depending the results of \ref{main_usage}.

Two kinds of model can be planned during this phase: semi-formal models to  cover the SSRS (D2.6-02-047.01) and strictly formal  models to  focuss on some functional and safety aspects (D2.6-02-049).  Obviously some strictly  formal means can be used to define the semi-formal  model.

\subsection{Semi-formal model}

Concerning semi-formal model, how the WP2 requirements are covered ?

\end{tabular}
\begin{author_comment}
The link with the SSRS may be really easy if the SSRS is modeled
with SysML.

For the coverage, I do not know and I did not try.


Simulation,animation  and execution may be done by additional plug-in
or by different tools.
\end{author_comment}
Concerning safety properties management, how the WP2 requirements are covered ?

\end{tabular}
\begin{author_comment}
SysML formalism may be used to add constraints representing assertion
or properties. This can then be check by plug-in or external tools
During the modeling activities I did not try these requirements, I can
not say much about it.
\end{author_comment}
Does the language allow to  formalize (D2.6-02-069):

\paragraph{Additional comments on semi-formal  model} Do you think your semi-formal  model is sufficient to cover a safe design of the on-board unit until code generation ?
All comments on links to  other models, validation and verification activities are welcomed.
\begin{author_comment}
SysML \cite{sysmlbook} is a good candidate for theses purposes.

\begin{assessor1}
\begin{itemize}
\item Safety function isolation :  No special feature to support this.

\end{tabular}
\begin{author_comment}

The formal semantics of SysML is described in textual form in the UML and SysML standards
(see \url{http://www.omg.org/spec/UML/2.3/Superstructure/PDF/}, \url{http://www.omg.org/spec/SysML/1.2/PDF/})

The Chapters about State Machines in the UML
document gives a rather clear description (thought not really easy
to read ...) about the intended behaviors of state machines and the
semantic variation points that are NOT fixed by the standard, but may
be interpreted in different ways. More mathematical descriptions can
be found in  many research papers.
\end{author_comment}

\begin{assessor1}
The ambiguity of state machine semantics let me reduce the "`state machines"' criterion to 2. 
\end{assessor1}


\paragraph{Additional comments on semi-formal  model} Do you think your strictly formal  model can be directly defined from the SSRS ?
All comments on links to  other models, validation and verification activities are welcomed.

\begin{author_comment}
SysML is a good candidate for these purposes
\end{author_comment}
\section{Software design}
This section discusses the usage of the approach for software design.
It can be skipped depending the results of \ref{main_usage}.

\subsection{Functional design}

How the approach allows to  produce a functional software model of the on-board unit ?

\end{assessor1}

\subsection{SSIL4 design}

How the approach allows to produce in safety a software model ?

\begin{tabular}{|l | c | c | c | c|}
\hline

\end{tabular}
\begin{author_comment}
SysML is a modeling language, it can also be used to design
software. EA first purpose is not to provide a software development
infrastructure. This can be realized through plug-in or with external
tools.
EA itself does not provide mechanism for error detecting code ...
\end{author_comment}

\begin{assessor1}
The * criteria are out of scope of EA and SysML; EA und SysML do not inhibit or support it.
\end{assessor1}

\section{Software code generation}
This section discusses the usage of the approach for software code generation.
It can be skipped depending the results of \ref{main_usage}.

Which criteria for software design and implementation are covered by the methodology
(see EN50128 table A.4) :

\begin{tabular}{|l | c | c | c | c|}
\hline
& \textcolor{green}{Author} & \textcolor{blue}{Assessor 1} & \textcolor{magenta}{Assessor 2} & Total \\

\hline
Design and coding standards (mandatory) &3 & 3& 1& 7 \\
\hline
Strongly typed programming language &3 & 3& 2 & 8  \\
\hline

\end{tabular}

\begin{assessor2}
Design and coding standards (mandatory): Although SysML is standardized, SysML or EA do not prescribe a certain coding standard, i.e. the language elements can be used freely. This can lead to "`broken"' models, e.g. a model containing internal block diagramm without a corresponding block. Coding standards would need to be defined externally.
Strongly typed programming language: Blocks can use properties which are not typed. EA does not check types even if they are defined.
\end{assessor2}

For the tool chain integration it depends on the integration methods
choosen. If it is only by exchanging XMI file, there is no problem.

\section{Other comments}
Please to  give free comments on the approach.

\begin{assessor1}
The strength of the SysML/EA approach is the high level transformation of an informal spec into a (semi-)formal one. 
For executable code generation (including a runnable of the whole functionality in one model), execution, debugging, simulation and verification it should be complemented with languages/tools that focus on these issues.

\begin{assessor2}
I agree to assessor 1.
