\paragraph{Abstract} 

The following evaluation of petri nets and the CPN Tools is in contrast to all other means of description not based on a preliminary model but on earlier formal model of the then current ERTMS/ETCS specification done for Deutsche Bahn AG in 1997. This work developed a full formal system model which was able to provide a
universal means of description for all the development phases. Thereby, an integrated event and data-oriented approach has been used, which is able to describe the different aspects of the  system  on  their  own net  levels.  Coloured Petri nets have been as means of description for this procedure, as they permit universal application, the use of different methods and formal analysis. CPN Tools is a mature tool suite which provides support to edit, check, simulate and analyse nets on all relevant abstraction levels.

\section{Main usage of the approach}
\label{main_usage}
The approach has been used to develop a strictly formal model based on an earlier  System  Requirements  Specification version. Therefore the approach uses context, process, scenario and function models to provide visualisation of the system and sub-systen processes as well as the operational processes. 
Petri Nets as a means of description are used in research an in industrial applications used for Process Modeling, Data analysis, Software design and Reliability engineering. Coloured Petri Nets are  High-level Petri Nets which are mainly used to describe, simulate and validated communication between humans and/or computers. As a means of description Coloured and  Hierarchic Petri nets allow to use one uniform means of description for the entire development cycle, starting with  the specification through to  implementation. In addition Petri  nets  provide  the capacity  that allows  different  methods  to  be  used  during  one  single  phase  of  the  development cycle  and also phase-specific methods.
CPN Tools has a graphical editor to model nets and provides various methods to analyse the nets, most importantly a reachability analysis. Resprechtivily the tool supports most applications for Coloured Petri Nets.

According to the figure \ref{fig:main_process}, the approach is recommanded for the following phases (note from 0 to  3) :

\end{tabular}

\paragraph{Known usages} 

The first goal of the openETCS project, formalising subset 26, has already been handled by this approach as  an earlier version of the ERTMS system requirement specifications has been modeled this way. Thereby it  was  demonstrated  that  during  the  phases  of  system development, covering the system specification through to the final system design, a  model based on Petri nets can be used.

\paragraph{Documentation} Coloured petri nets are standardised as part of the high level petri nets in ISO/IEC 15909 Systems and software engineering - High-level Petri nets. The use of petri nets for the system dependability analysis is standardised in IEC 62551 Analysis techniques for dependability - Petri net modeling. In addition Coloured petri nets and the CPN Tools are introduced and documented in the book \textit{Coloured Petri Nets -- Modeling and Validation of Concurrent Systems} by K. Jensen and L.M. Kristensen. 

\paragraph{Language usage} Basically petri nets are a very powerful completely mathematical defined means of description to graphically model systems in a discrete way. Over the time various extensions have be developed to extend the concept of petri nets to handle a larger amount of system properties and  behaviour. Some of these extensions require export knowledge, so that their models can be difficult to understand for users not familiar with the theory behind petri nets.

\section{System Analysis}
This section discusses the usage of the approach for system analysis.

Acoording WP2 requirements, the approach can be involved for the sub-system requirement specification in the following ways:

\end{tabular}



\section{Sub-System formal design}
This section discusses the usage of the approach for sub-system formal design.

Petri nets can be used to model both kind of models during this phase: semi-formal models tocover the SSRS (D2.6-02-047.01) and strictly formal  models to  focus on some functional and safety aspects (D2.6-02-049).  Obviously petri nets as a strictly  formal means can be used to define the semi-formalmodel.

\subsection{Semi-formal model}

Concerning semi-formal model, the following WP2 requirements are covered:

\end{tabular}

\begin{assessor2}

\hline

\hline
\end{tabular}

Coloured Petri nets allow to  formalize the following(D2.6-02-069):

\begin{tabular}{|l | c | c | c | c|}
\hline
& \textcolor{green}{Author} & \textcolor{blue}{Assessor 1} & \textcolor{magenta}{Assessor 2} & Total \\

\hline
\end{tabular}

\paragraph{Additional comments on semi-formal  model} 
Since the approach has already been used to model the ERTMS/ETCS specification in an earlier version, it is sufficient for the task.
As petri nets are closely related to all means of descriptions based on state machines and automatas the can be compared or translated relatively easy. In addition all verification and validation activities supported by those means of descriptions can be used on petri nets. Although hazard and risk analysis techniques as FTA and FMEA can be translated intro petri nets and petri nets can be used for formal hazard and risk analysis methods.

\end{tabular}

\paragraph{Additional comments on semi-formal  model} 
Petri nets models can be build directly from the SSRS and then be systematically refined. 
Since petri nets are closely related to all means of descriptions based on state machines and automatas the can be compared or translated relatively easy. In addition all verification and validation activities supported by those means of descriptions can be used on petri nets. Although hazard and risk analysis techniques as FTA and FMEA can be translated intro petri nets and petri nets can be used for formal hazard and risk analysis methods.


\section{Software design}
This section discusses the usage of the approach for software design.

\subsection{Functional design}

The approach allows to  produce a functional software model of the on-board unit in the following ways:

\begin{tabular}{|l | c | c | c | c|}
\hline
& \textcolor{green}{Author} & \textcolor{blue}{Assessor 1} & \textcolor{magenta}{Assessor 2} & Total \\
\hline

\hline

\paragraph{Modelling support}
Since petri nets are a primarily graphic means of descrition CPN Tools provide a graphical modelling editor.

\paragraph{Automatic translation and code generation}
CPN Tools does not directly generate source code, but the petri nets models are provided in the CPN ML file format, which can be used by other tools to create code. Petri nets can relatively easy been translated to other means of description based on state machines and automatas. 

\paragraph{Model verification}
Petri nets are mainly verified by generation and analysis of the state space. The tool supports the calculation and drawing of the state space, which is used to verify certain logical and temporal properties of the system.

\paragraph{Test generation}
CPN Tools itself allows simulation of the models. It does not support test generation, but provides interfaces for other tools to do so. Correspondingly, tools like SPENAT can be used to generate and manage all kinds of tests for the nets created with CPN Tools.

\paragraph{Simulation, execution, debugging}
The simulation engine of CPN tools provides a powerful simulation of petri nets and has a number of debugging functions.

\paragraph{Formal proof}
Petri nets are a strictly formal means of description suited for formal proof of behavioural and structural properties. The analysis of the state space can provide proofs for some kinds of properties. Additional model checker can be combined with the tool to provide aditional functionalities.

\section{Other comments}
In the context of this approach coloured petri nets present only a very well suited formal means of description. However the method is basically independent of the means of description and can also be applied on other formal means of description. Thereby the proven method to build context models which are then further refined in process, scenario and function models can be successfully used for many formal means of description.
