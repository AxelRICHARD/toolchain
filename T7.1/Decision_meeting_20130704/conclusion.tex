\begin{frame}{Open questions}


\begin{itemize}
\item 
How to use SysML and SCADE during the process (vertical integration) (WP2-WP7) ?
\item How to integrate the approaches on the whole process (VnV, Safety,...) (horizontal integration) (WP2-WP4) ?
\item
Close property (WP1-WP7) ?
\item
Integration of Scade on eclipse  tool platform (WP7) ?
\item
Who has knowledge to made effort on modelling with these approaches (WP3) ?
\item 
Who has knowledge to made effort on VnV, safety,... around these approaches (WP4) ?
\item
Who has knowledge to participate to the development of the tool chain on these approaches (WP7) ?
\end{itemize}
