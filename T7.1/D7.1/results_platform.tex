\chapter{Results on tool platform}
The tool platform should provide mechanisms to integrate various
tools. The tool platform is not the primary nor secondary tools, nor
the tool chain. It is the support for the tool chain implementation,
it shall help to integrate the tools into a seamless tool chain.
The evaluation will focus on the integration capabilities of the tool platform.

Description of the candidates by Cecile Braunstein
\end{todo_comment}

\section{Initial list of candidates}
\begin{itemize}
\item  Eclipse 
\item  TopCased/Polarsys
\item RTP-Cesar
\item Mono/.NET 
\item SCADE
\end{itemize}

After a first round, Mono/.NET and  SCADE were discard because they do
not comply to our tool platform definition.
RTP-CESAR was also discard, the maturity of this project is not yet
usable. Finally, Eclipse with the modeling framework (EMF) has been chosen as a tool platform, the possibility
to use Polarsys and take some part of the TopCased tool chain as well
as which version of Eclipse and EMF are
discussed in the next sections.
It has also be decided that any framework added to Eclipse should be
documented.

\section{Topcased and Polarsys}

Topcased is a tool for systems engineering, based on Eclipse and various Eclipse projects.  Polarsys is a project concerned with the long term support of the Topcased tool chain.  There is an overlap between Topcased and the openETCS tool chain.  There is also an overlap between the objectives of openETCS and Polarsys:

\textbf{Topcased and openETCS tool chain.} Both, Topcased and the openETCS tool chain are based on Eclipse.  Further, the openETCS tool chain will definitely use Papyrus, which is also part of Topcased.  And last, both are concerned with covering all aspects of the V-Model, although for different domains (aviation vs. rail).

\textbf{Polarsys and openETCS.}  The objectives of Polarsys and openETCS overlap significantly as well: Both are concerned with tools in a safety-critical domain, requiring tool qualification, etc.  They are also concerned with long term support through open source.

\subsection{State of Topcased and Polarsys}

While the state of the art document mentions Topcased \cite{}, it was not evaluated as a whole.  Merely the Papyurus component of Topcased was evaluated, but a newer version than the one used by Topcased.

Topcased is using a fork of an old version of Papyrus (Ver. 0.8.2) which is no more supported by the CEA (actual version 0.10.X) and, as the CEA is not part of Topcased, no more code development over this version/Topcased will be done by CEA.  Unfortunately, the development on Topcased modeler (forked version of Papyrus) is not so active anymore: 60 commits on the 3 last months (as of July 2013) against more than 1600 commit for Papyrus.  Further, the actual version of Papyrus have been greatly improved with respect to stability since version 0.8.2, and some stability issues may have not been corrected in Topcased.

To conclude, Topcased requires Eclipse 3.7.2 Indigo (1.5 year-old version) which is no more supported by the Eclipse foundation.  Some part of Topcased initiative (plugins/add-ons) may still be very useful to the openETCS project, so we will reach out to the Polarsys community to see whether there is an interest in aligning versions for long term support.  The versions currently used in Topcased are not suitable for the openETCS tool chain, unfortunately.
