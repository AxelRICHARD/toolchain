\section{Topcased and Polarsys}

Topcased is a tool for systems engineering, based on Eclipse and various Eclipse projects.  Polarsys is a project concerned with the long term support of the Topcased tool chain.  There is an overlap between Topcased and the openETCS tool chain.  There is also an overlap between the objectives of openETCS and Polarsys:

\textbf{Topcased and openETCS tool chain.} Both, Topcased and the openETCS tool chain are based on Eclipse.  Further, the openETCS tool chain will definitely use Papyrus, which is also part of Topcased.  And last, both are concerned with covering all aspects of the V-Model, although for different domains (aviation vs. rail).

\textbf{Polarsys and openETCS.}  The objectives of Polarsys and openETCS overlap significantly as well: Both are concerned with tools in a safety-critical domain, requiring tool qualification, etc.  They are also concerned with long term support through open source.

\subsection{State of Topcased and Polarsys}

While the state of the art document mentions Topcased \cite{}, it was not evaluated as a whole.  Merely the Papyurus component of Topcased was evaluated, but a newer version than the one used by Topcased.

Topcased is using a fork of an old version of Papyrus (Ver. 0.8.2) which is no more supported by the CEA (actual version 0.10.X) and, as the CEA is not part of Topcased, no more code development over this version/Topcased will be done by CEA.  Unfortunately, the development on Topcased is not so active anymore: 60 commits on the 3 last months (as of July 2013) against more than 1600 commit for Papyrus.  Further, the actual version of Papyrus have been greatly improved with respect to stability since version 0.8.2, and some stability issues may have not been corrected in Topcased.

To conclude, Topcased requires Eclipse 3.7.2 Indigo (1.5 year-old version) which is no more supported by the Eclipse foundation.  We will reach out to the Polarsys community see whether there is an interest in aligning versions for long term support, but the versions currently used in Topcased are not suitable for the openETCS tool chain.
