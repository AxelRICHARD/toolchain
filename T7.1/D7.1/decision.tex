\chapter{Decision}
\label{sec:decision}

This chapter gives the decision done during the meeting of the 4th of July 2013.


\section{Decision on the tool platform}

By vote, all the partners agree on the use of \textbf{Eclipse} as tool platform.

The last release is Kepler 4.3, launched the 26 of June 2013.


\section{Decisions for high level step}

By vote, all the partners agree on the use of the \textbf{SysML} approach supported by the \textbf{Papyrus} tool to cover the higher level of the  OpenETCS V-cycle.

SysML 1.1 is completely supported on Papyrus, 1.2 is largely supported, moreover not implemented part of the norm may be added through motivated requests.
The last release of Papyrus is 0.10.0, launched the 26 of June 2013 and is based on Eclipse Kepler 4.3.

\section{Propositions of approach to cover all the design process}

No vote has been done during the meeting on the approaches to cover the lower  levels of OpenETCS V-cycle.
Three propositions of chain are still under evaluation:

\begin{itemize}
\item a combination of \textbf{SysML  and Scade} described in \ref{sec:sysML-Scade}
\item a combination of \textbf{SysML, ERTMSFormalSpec and Topcased} described in \ref{sec:sysML-EFS}
\item a combination of \textbf{SysML  and Classical B} described in \ref{sec:sysML-B}
\end{itemize}

For the moment, all the candidates of the short-list (see figure \ref{fig:short_list}) are still take in consideration for example to  cover lack  of the main tool chain or verification and validation purposes.
