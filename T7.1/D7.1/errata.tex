\section{Top level in the V-model}

Reported by Jan Welvaaarts at \url{https://github.com/openETCS/toolchain/issues/181}.

``At 8-10-13 decision 6 was accepted. In this requirement it is stated that sys-ML will be the top level in the V-model.
However the top level specification in the V-model for openETCS shall be the written (prose) specification (SRS analysis and functional descriptions).''
