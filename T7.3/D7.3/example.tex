&\textbf{Bitwalker - Import of Data Types and Variables}\\
Input&Subset-026-7, Subset-026-8, MS Word Format\\
Output&Database (XML) representing data types, variables and messages\\
Tool Class&T3\\
          &The resulting definitions are direct input to the model and thus any fault may be propagated down to the code level\\
Safety Integrity Level&? \textcolor{red}{[Currently I do not have the EN 50128 standard available]}\\
Potential errors&The following list is not exhaustive and shall just give some ideas. The feature implementor has to provide more detail.
                                \begin{itemize}
                                  \item Variable / message / type not detected or missing in output\newline
                                       Mitigation: This error can possibly be detected avoided as the modelling process is manual. Required in- or output described in the
                                                   SRS can be added manually if missing.
                                  \item Variable or message have wrong type (*)\newline
                                       This is a very dangerous error, especially in the case of different precision integers or floats. The error may
                                       remain unnoticed and be propagated to the code leading to potentially fatal malfunctions. A mitigation is only possible by
                                       manual recheck (which would make an automatic conversion obsolete) of extensive/exhaustive testing or verification of the tool 
                                       implementing the feature. However the inconsistent nature of the input document (Word) could prevent this.
                                  \item Missing fields in record / message\newline
                                       Mitigation: Can be detected if the functionality of the field is described in the functional description.
                                  \item Wrong naming of variable / message / type (**)\newline
                                       Mitigation: Potentially dangerous if names of variables (of compatible type) are mixed up. The risk is the same as for wrong typing.
                                  \item ...
                                \end{itemize}
                               \\
Providing evidence&It will be necessary to provide evidence that critical errors such as (*) and (**) can be detected or are not present in the tool. 
                   Exhaustive verification will be difficult due to the unreliable structure of the input document. The result must be correct
                   also for ill-formed documents. A solution would be to let ERA acknowledge the converted XML database as a formal document. In this case the tool can be classified T1.
