	abstract = {A key issue in current computer-aided software engineering {CASE} environ- ments is the desire to link tools that address different aspects of the develop- ment process. Typically, these tools are produced by different vendors, each of whom has chosen to focus on a specific part of the overall problem. For example, different tools support architectural design and test case generation. Users of these tools want them to work together to fully support the user's design and development process. Thus, tool integration is intended to produce complete environments that support the entire software development life cycle. There are five types of tool integration issues that must be addressed. These can be termed platform integration, presentation integration, data integration, control integration, and process integration. Each of these is briefly described, followed by a short discussion of the contribution of open architecture to tool integration. The paper concludes with an overview of the integration techniques employed in {IDE's} Software through Pictures 1 environment. Emphasis is given to commercially available products and approaches, reflecting the need of large- scale software developers for these integrated software engineering environments.},
