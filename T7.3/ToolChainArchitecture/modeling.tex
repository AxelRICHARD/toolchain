It has been decided \cite{} to use SysML as a modeling language and
papyrus as modeling tool. \todo{add references}

The use of SysML is restricted to the following :
\begin{itemize}
\item Requirements:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Requirement Diagram
    \item Requirement relationships : {\tt verify}/{\tt satisfy}/{\tt
        trace}
  \end{itemize}
\item Structures:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Block Diagram
    \item Internal Block Diagram
    \item Ports
  \end{itemize}
\item Behaviors:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item State machines
  \item Activity diagram (optional)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

All tool  should be able to understand and to produce the same SysML format.
