\label{sec:transfo}

This section is dedicated to tools and means for model transformation and code generation.



\section{Candidates}

The list of initial candidates is shown below.  Those tools without a a reference on a subsection have not been evaluated further, due to lack of engagement (no partner was willing to sponsor such an evaluation).

\begin{description}
\item [Scade Suite]
\item [Rodin and Pluggins]
\item [Acceleo] see \ref{sec:Acceleo}.
\item [ATL]
\item [QVTO and SmartQVT]
\item [Xtend]

\subsection{Acceleo}
\label{sec:Acceleo}

\begin{description}
\item[Name] Acceleo
\item[Web site] http://www.eclipse.org/acceleo/
\item[Licence] Eclipse
\end{description}

\paragraph{Abstract} %Short abstract on the approach and tool (10 lines max)
Acceleo is an implementation of the Object Management Group (OMG) MOF Model to Text Language (MTL) standard. Based on a special template language model to text transformations can be defined. It is fully integrated with Eclipse and also part of Polarsys.

\paragraph{Publications} %Short list of publications on the approach (5 max)
\begin{itemize}
\item Most information is available on the homepage http://www.eclipse.org/acceleo/
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Added value for OpenETCS project}


Acceleo as a model-to-text (M2T) transformation language supports generating textual artifacts from templates. Therefore, M2T transformation is ideally suited for code generation purposes e.g. form abstract SysML models to make them executable and testable. Providing executable specification will provide a momentous benefit to the project. In the openETCS project, Acceleo will be used to have a transformation from SysML models to IEEE standardized language SystemC. 


\paragraph{Integration in OpenETCS process and toolchain}

\begin{itemize}
\item Acceleo is based on the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF)
\item This brings compatibility with any tool that produces EMF compatible models.
\end{itemize}

\section{Selected means and tools}

We did not explicitly evaluate the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF), which has already been chosen as part of the primary toolchain (D7.1).  EMF has powerful model transformation capabilities which may be sufficient for many tasks.  Beyond that, no other final tools have been selected.
