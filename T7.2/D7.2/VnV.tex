\subsection{SystemC}

\begin{description}
\item[Name] SystemC
\item[Web site] \url{www.accellera.org/downloads/standards/systemc/about_systemc/}
\item[Licence] SystemC Open Source License
\end{description}

\paragraph{Abstract} SystemC is a C++ library providing an event-driven simulation interface suitable for electronic system level design. It enables a system designer to simulate concurrent processes. SystemC processes can communicate in a simulated real-time environment, using channels of different datatypes (all C++ types and user defined types are supported). SystemC supports hardware and software synthesis (with the corresponding tools). SystemC models are executable.

\subsection{UPPAAL}

\begin{description}
\item[Name] UPPAAL
\item[Web site] www.uppaal.org
\item[Licence] Academic free or commercial license
\end{description}

\paragraph{Abstract} Uppaal is an integrated tool environment for modeling, validation and verification of real-time systems modeled as networks of timed automata, extended with data types (bounded integers, arrays, etc.).

\subsection{CPN Tools}



\begin{description}
\item[Name] CPN Tools
\item[Website] http://cpntools.org/
\item[Licence] Open Source (GPL/LGPL)
\end{description}

\paragraph{Abstract} CPN Tools is a tool for editing, simulating, and analyzing Colored Petri nets.

The tool features incremental syntax checking and code generation, which take place while a net is being constructed. A fast simulator efficiently handles untimed and timed nets. Full and partial state spaces can be generated and analyzed, and a standard state space report contains information, such as boundedness properties and liveness properties.

%------------------------------- RT-Tester
\subsection{RT-Tester}

\begin{description}
\item[Name] RT-Tester
\item[Web site] http://www.verified.de/en/products/rt-tester
\item[Licence] 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Generator:  closed
    \item SMT Solver: open
    \item GUI (eclipse plug-in): open
  \end{itemize}
\end{description}

\paragraph{Abstract}
The RT-Tester test automation tool, made by Verified, performs
automatic test generation, test execution and real-time test
evaluation.  It supports different testing approach such as unit
testing, software integration testing for component, hardware/software
integration testing and system integration testing.  
The tool generates automatically behavioral tests that covers the
classical criteria such as  reachable state, branch and MC/DC.
The RT-Tester also implements the so-called  model-based testing approach: 
starting from a test model design with UML/SysML, the RT-tester fully
automatically generates test cases. Moreover the test model may be
directly linked to the requirements, thus the requirement coverage may
also be ensured.

The RT-tester provides the following features :
\begin{itemize}
\item Automated Test Case Generation 
\item Automated Test Data and Test Oracles Generation 
\item Automated Test Procedure Generation 
\item Automated Requirement Tracing 
\item Test Management system 
\item Test Report Generation
\end{itemize}


Note that the RT-tester model based testing has be qualified according
to ISO 26262.

\end{itemize} 

\paragraph{Added value for OpenETCS project}

RT-Tester will add  an automated test case and test data generator
that interprets test models directly describes in SysML. 
The test models may specify concurrent sub-components of
SUT (System Under Test) and TE (Test Environment), and timing
conditions using dense time (i. e., continuous physical time) and 
an arbitrary number of timers. 

Another added value is that the tool also provides a simulation
environment that can directly generate C code from the SysML model and
run the tests.
The code generator may also be adapted to other purposes.

\paragraph{Integration in OpenETCS process and toolchain}

\begin{itemize}
  \item GUI via an eclipse plug-in already exist,
  \item read SysML model
  \item Can run SCADE generated code
\end{itemize}
