\chapter{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The aim of this document is to report the results of the evaluation of means and tools for the secondary toolchain, i.e. the means and tools which complete the primary tool chain dedicated to formal model and software design.

This evaluation task is part of work package WP7, task 2 "Secondary  tools analyses and recommendations". According to the results of WP2, especially the OpenETCS process and the
requirements on language and tools \citep{D2_6}, and the results of T7.1 on the primary toolchain \citep{D7.1},  the aim of this task is to determine the best candidates to complete and support the primary toolchain for the following activities:

\begin{itemize}
\item data, function and requirement management (SSRS, WP3 and WP4), in chapter \ref{sec:management};
\item verification and  validation (WP4), in chapter \ref{sec:VnV};
\item safety activities support (WP4), in chapter \ref{sec:safety};
\item model transformation and code generation (WP3 and WP4), in chapter \ref{sec:transfo}.
\end{itemize}
