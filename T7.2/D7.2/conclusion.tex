\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{sec:concl}

The challenges posed by evaluating secondary technologies turned out to be quite different than those from the primary technologiees (see D7.1).  The primary tools created some strong opinions and discussions at time, due to the central nature of the primary tools.  In contrast, it was hard to engage partners in evaluating secondary tools:  First, because the imporance was not as visible, and second, because there was no immediate need.  Due to the availability of the primary tools, work could get started.

In spite of these challenges, we believe that we created a solid reference that will make selection of secondary tools on an ``as needed'' basis easy and quick.  There is a good chance that new, unexpected tool requirements will apear during the reminder of this project.  In that case, this report will be amended with additional evaluations.
